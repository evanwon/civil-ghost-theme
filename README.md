Civil, a theme for Ghost
=================

Civil is a clean, simple and responsive theme for the Ghost blogging platform (http://ghost.org).

### Styling

For base styling, this theme uses a modified version of https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch, located at https://github.com/evanwon/bootswatch. (Bootswatch is, itself, based on https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap). 

My goal is to modify this base stylesheet as little as possible, and instead add any customizations to `assets/custom.css`.
